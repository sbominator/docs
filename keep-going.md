**SBOM Creation is Just the First Step**

* **Imagine a Recipe Without Cooking:**  
   Creating an SBOM is like writing down a recipe with all the ingredients for your website. However, if you never actually use the recipe to cook, you won‚Äôt end up with a meal. Similarly, an SBOM is only useful if you use it to check the ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù and safety of each component in your site.

üõ† **Why Acting on SBOM Findings is Essential**

* **Identify Vulnerable Components:**

  * **Spot the Problem:**  
     An SBOM lists all the software parts (plugins, themes, libraries) used in your site. If one of these parts is found to be insecure or outdated, the SBOM lets you quickly identify which sites are at risk.  
  * **Take Action:**  
     Instead of just creating the list, you must update or replace any vulnerable component.  
  * **Learn More:**  
     For details on vulnerability management, see the [NIST Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-161/final).  
      
* **Maintain Security Over Time:**

  * **Ongoing Monitoring:**  
     New security threats can emerge at any time. Regularly reviewing your SBOM ensures you catch and fix issues as they develop‚Äîlike checking the expiration dates on your ingredients.  
  * **Automation Helps:**  
     Tools can scan your SBOM continuously to alert you about security patches or updates needed, making maintenance proactive rather than reactive.  
      
* **Enhance Compliance and Trust:**

  * **Meeting Standards:**  
     Simply generating an SBOM might meet basic regulatory requirements. However, regulatory bodies expect that you actively use that information to secure your site.  
  * **Building User Trust:**  
     When you act on SBOM findings, you ensure your site is safer for visitors. This proactive stance builds trust with your users and clients.  
  * **More Information:**  
     Check out the [OWASP Software Component Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-software-component-verification/) for further insights on maintaining software security.

üí° **In Summary**

* **SBOMs Aren‚Äôt Just Paperwork:**  
   When used actively, they are dynamic tools that allow you to identify and remedy security vulnerabilities.  
* **Continuous Improvement:**  
   Without ongoing action‚Äîlike updating, patching, and monitoring‚Äîyour website remains at risk even if you have a complete list of its components.  
* **A Proactive Approach is Key:**  
   By regularly interpreting and acting on SBOM data, you meet compliance standards and create a safer, more resilient website environment.

Using your SBOM as a tool for continuous improvement means you're not just ticking a box‚Äîyou‚Äôre actively protecting your site from potential threats and ensuring that every ‚Äúingredient‚Äù in your software recipe remains secure.
