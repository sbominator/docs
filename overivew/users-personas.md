## **ü§î When Do Site Owners Need to Use an SBOM and Why?**

### **For Site Owners**

* **During Site Deployment & Updates:**

  * **What:** Generate or review an SBOM when launching a new website or updating existing software.  
  * **Why:** Ensures every code component‚Äîsuch as plugins, themes, and libraries‚Äîis documented and current, helping to pinpoint vulnerabilities if an issue arises quickly.  
* **When a Security Incident Occurs:**

  * **What:** Use the SBOM to check if a vulnerable or outdated component is used when a security flaw is discovered.  
  * **Why:** Speeds up patching or removing the risky element, minimizing potential damage.  
* **For Regular Maintenance & Audits:**

  * **What:** Regularly review SBOMs during routine maintenance or audits.  
  * **Why:** It acts as a comprehensive checklist to ensure all components comply with security standards and that nothing is missing or outdated.

### **For Other Personas**

* **Compliance Officers:**

  * **Creation:** Collaborate with IT teams to generate SBOMs as part of compliance documentation.  
  * **Interpretation:** Use SBOMs during audits or regulatory reviews to verify that all software components are secure and meet government or industry standards.

* **Web Hosts:**

  * **Creation:** Generate SBOMs for each hosted website to monitor the overall health and security of the systems they manage.  
  * **Interpretation:** Regularly review SBOM findings to identify common vulnerabilities across hosted sites, supporting proactive maintenance.  
    * *Additional Info:* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/)  
* **Agencies:**

  * **Creation:** Create SBOMs for client websites as part of a service package to ensure all projects adhere to best practices.  
  * **Interpretation:** Use SBOM reports to communicate with clients about potential risks and necessary updates, ensuring transparency and trust.  
    * **Why:** This not only supports overall security but also aids in managing long-term maintenance and compliance for multiple clients.

### **üí° In Summary**

* **Site Owners**: Leverage SBOMs during deployment, updates, or when a security incident is flagged to identify and address vulnerabilities quickly.  
* **Compliance Officers**: Review SBOMs during audits to verify that all software components meet regulatory standards.  
* **Web Hosts**: Utilize SBOMs to monitor and manage the security of numerous websites under their care.  
* **Agencies**: Employ SBOMs to secure client sites, maintain transparency, and facilitate proactive maintenance.

Each group benefits from having a clear ‚Äúingredients list‚Äù of the software they manage. This is essential for spotting vulnerabilities early and ensuring all components remain secure and compliant with industry regulations.
