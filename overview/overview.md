# SBOMinator 3000 Overview

**Introduction**  
SBOMinator 3000 is a tool that enhances Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management and strengthens software supply chain security for CMS platforms and PHP frameworks. It helps developers, security teams, and compliance officers quickly identify and fix vulnerabilities in third-party code.

**Problem Statement**

* **Third-Party Dependencies:**  
   Many websites rely on plugins, themes, and libraries that may become outdated or compromised, increasing security risks.  
* **Regulatory Demands:**  
  [Executive Order 14028](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity) and the [EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act) require clear supply chain transparency and secure practices.  
* **Inconsistent SBOM Practices:**  
  Multiple SBOM formats (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX) can make integration into CMS and PHP frameworks challenging.

**SBOMinator Solution**

* **SBOM Aggregator:**  
  Quickly compiles a detailed list of all software components.  
* **PHP level library CMS agnostic**  
  It works at PHP level as light library that can be integrated with other systems  
* **Seamless Integration:**  
  Designed for popular CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla) and PHP frameworks (Laravel, Symfony).  
* **Accurate Insights:**  
  Provides up-to-date compliance, license information and security data to enable proactive maintenance.  
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI), with plans for broader support.

### Output of this library

* Dependencies tree  
* CycloneDx based file: \`sbom.json\`

**Key Use Cases**

* **CMS & PHP Developers:**  
  Can be plugged into the maintenance system to keep plugins, themes, and libraries up-to-date and track vulnerabilities and supply chain information.  
* **Compliance Officers:**  
  Leverage SBOMs for audits and to ensure regulatory compliance.  
* **Web Hosts & Agencies:**  
  Monitor multiple sites and generate automated security reports to reduce maintenance costs. Monitoring numerous sites and generating automated security reports is essential to minimize maintenance costs effectively. Closely monitoring various locations can identify and address potential security threats promptly. Automated security reports streamline this process by providing regular updates and insights without the need for constant manual oversight. This saves time and reduces the resources required for maintenance, ultimately leading to cost savings.

## Next steps

* Connect to Threat intelligence to identify vulnerabilities and threats.  
* Check for outdated dependencies.

**Conclusion**  
SBOMinator is more than a documentation tool—it’s a proactive solution for maintaining secure and compliant websites. By actively using SBOM insights, organizations can safeguard their software supply chain and meet evolving security requirements.
